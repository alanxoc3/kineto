# kineto
This is a fork of [kineto][kineto], which is hosted at source hut. Some extra notes:

* Kineto is a gemini to http proxy.
* Gemini is a simple protocol for hipsters who don't like the modern web.
* The changes in this repo are specific to my website setup, which you can find at [alanxoc3.xyz][alanxoc3].
* My [dotfiles repo][dotfiles] has some scripts that show more of my gemini & website setup.
* As of 2021-07-03, the [official gemini website][gemini] is also hosted with kineto.
